        <h1> Title: The effect of different amounts of threads in
asynchronous methods for deep
reinforcement learning</h1>
        <h3> Abstract </h3>
        <p> In this paper we present the effects of asynchronous training in Deep Reinforcement Learning
methods. An Actor-Critic method using eligibility traces has been implemented to solve the
CartPole problem, and the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm, have
been implemented to solve both the CartPole problem and to play Atari games. The results
from the A3C method show it is possible to achieve an increase of 631,27\% in the number of
performed actions for several Atari games, while maintaining the same stability in learning as
a single-threaded approach. However, when the A3C algorithm was applied to the CartPole
problem we only achieved a speed-up of 15,09% in time spent training. The results indicated
that the advantages of asynchronous learning are only present, when each thread can perform
a meaningful amount of work between each asynchronous update.

        <h1> Title: Normalisation of T1 Brain Images using Deep Learning </h1>
        <h3> Abstract </h3>
        <p> When a brain is scanned by an MRI machine, the image can be corrupted by a low-frequency
signal, that can alter some of the pixel values - a so-called bias field signal[Kur+05]. Al-
gorithms that depend on precise pixels values in images can, therefore, produce misleading
results. Thus, before image processing algorithms can be used with satisfactory results, a
pre-processing step is required. In this project we investigate the possibility of removing
the bias field signal using a deep learning approach.
